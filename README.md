Taking and analyzing the city school district's standardized testing results in order to make decisions about future funding and budgets.

By analyzing the presented data across the 15 schools in the district, we are able to see the total number of students in high school plus their average math and reading scores, as well as, budget for the school and how that is delegated per student accounted for. These numbers were used to determine the top and bottom performers in regard to test scores for students in 9th-12th grade. In addition, the data shows the relationship between school spending and testing success.

With that, there is a positive relationship between school spending and successful testing averages when comparing Charter Schools vs District Schools. The more money funded per student, the higher the math, reading, and overall testing averages were. Similarly, the small (<1000) and medium sized (1000-2000) schools performed better across the board than the larger sized (2000-5000) schools. This can lead to the conclusion that, according to this data set, the smaller the student population and more monetary resources provided per student, makes for an overall more successful testing average in math and reading for their high school students. The top 5 performing schools are all Charter while the bottom 5 are all District.
